# Introduction

`xcmsGUI-Zhulab` is a GUI tool to detect MS peaks with `xcms` `R` package. It can detect MS peaks with XCMS using mzXML data and export MSMS spectra to `MGF` format. Users can also use vender data generated by MS instrument directly. `xcmsGUI-Zhulab` will detect MS peaks after converting the data to `mzXML` files with `MSConvert` in `ProteoWizard` and export MSMS spectra to MGF format.
